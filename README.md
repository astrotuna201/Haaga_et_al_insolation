## Forcing of late Pleistocene ice volume by spatially variable summer energy
This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses and figures for Haaga KA, Diego D, Hannisdal B, Brendryen, Forcing of late Pleistocene ice volume by spatially variable summer energy (submitted).

## Instructions 
### Preprocessing
Loading the data used in the paper is done with the `preprocessing/preprocessing.R` script. Running this generates a data table containing all the necessary data for the CCM analyses. For details on the preprocessing, check out the source code for the other files in the `preprocessing/` folder. *Note: this might take several hours, depending on your system specs*.
